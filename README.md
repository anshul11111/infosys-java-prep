###  **Day-Wise Java Syllabus Breakdown**

####  **Day 1–2: Java Fundamentals**
- **Topics Covered**: Basic syntax, variables, data types, operators, control flow (if-else, loops).
- **Tip**: These days are crucial for building a strong foundation. Practice simple programs like calculating factorial, reversing strings, etc.

####  **Day 3–4: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Topics Covered**: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction.
- **Insight**: Focus on understanding how real-world entities are modeled in code. Try building small class hierarchies to grasp inheritance.

####  **Day 5–6: Exception Handling & File I/O**
- **Topics Covered**: Try-catch blocks, finally, throw/throws, custom exceptions, file reading/writing using FileReader, BufferedReader, etc.
- **Advice**: Exception handling is often tested in hands-on rounds. Practice writing robust code that handles errors gracefully.

####  **Day 7–8: Collections Framework**
- **Topics Covered**: ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap, HashSet, TreeSet, Iterator.
- **Emphasis**: Learn the differences between each collection type and when to use them. Practice problems like frequency count, sorting maps, etc.

####  **Day 9–10: Final Review + Mock Tests**
- **Activities**: Revision of all topics, mock MCQs, and hands-on coding tests.
- **Strategy**: Focus on time management and accuracy. Review common mistakes and revisit weak areas.
