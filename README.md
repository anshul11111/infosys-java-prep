## **Day 1–2: Java Fundamentals**
- **Topics Covered**: Basic syntax, variables, data types, operators, control flow (`if-else`, loops).
- **Tip**: Build a strong foundation. Try programs like factorial calculation, string reversal, etc.

---

## **Day 3–4: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Topics Covered**: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction.
- **Insight**: Understand how real-world entities map to code. Create small class hierarchies to practice inheritance.

---

## **Day 5–6: Exception Handling & File I/O**
- **Topics Covered**: `try-catch`, `finally`, `throw/throws`, custom exceptions, file reading/writing (`FileReader`, `BufferedReader`, etc.).
- **Advice**: Exception handling is frequently tested. Write robust code that handles errors gracefully.

---

## **Day 7–8: Collections Framework**
- **Topics Covered**: `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `HashMap`, `HashSet`, `TreeSet`, `Iterator`.
- **Emphasis**: Learn the differences and use-cases of each. Practice problems like frequency counts and map sorting.

---

## **Day 9–10: Final Review + Mock Tests**
- **Activities**: Full revision, mock MCQs, hands-on coding tests.
- **Strategy**: Work on time management and accuracy. Review weak areas and avoid repeating common mistakes.

---

# 📝 Overall Guidance
- **Pre-Training Prep**: Revise Java basics beforehand to avoid overwhelm.  
- **Practice Daily**: Don’t leave practice until the end—code every day.  
- **Use Resources**: [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/), and [Java Docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/) will help.
